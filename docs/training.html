<h3>What is EventStorming?</h3><p>

EventStorming is a workshop format for exploring complex business domains, created by Alberto Brandolini (ca. 2013). It is both an iterative domain modelling and software design technique, and a collaborative learning activity.<p>

<h3>What will I learn?</h3><p>

Participants will experience an EventStorming workshop based on a real life scenario. We will “zoom out” at regular intervals to discuss and reflect on a meta level.<p>

They will:<p>
<ul>
  <li> get to know some core concepts of Domain Driven Design</li>
  <li> learn how to organize and facilitate an EventStorming workshop</li>
  <li> identify common patterns and anti-patterns</li>
  <li> acquire tools and techniques to resolve conflicts and keep the group’s energy level up</li>
  <li> apply concepts from Lean and Theory of Constraints to the domain model: Identify bottlenecks, find cost and value centres</li>
  <li> progress from domain modelling to software design, leveraging workshop outcomes to create better architectures</li>
</ul>

<h3>Agenda:</h3><p>

EventStorming is a highly dynamic and sometimes surprising format. Because we expect unforeseen things to happen, there isn’t a strict schedule or timetable. But we do have a plan:<p>

Day 1:<p>
0. Introduction to Domain Driven Design: Getting the gist of what’s about to happen, and why.<p>

1. Big Picture Event Storming<p>
<ul>
<li> Making the combined knowledge in the room appear on the wall, and starting to discover the domain</li>
<li> Common behaviour patterns and dynamics</li>
<li> How to address conflict and find agreement</li>
</ul>
<p>

2. The Picture That Explains Everything<p>
<ul>
<li> Progressing from agreement to understanding to insights,</li>
<li> Filling the gaps: Creating a readable, coherent model of the business domain</li>
<li> Identifying bounded contexts and processes</li>
<li> From actors to personas: What do we know about our users?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Day 2:<p>

3. A short, but necessary excursion into strategic domain modelling: Identifying Domain Driven Design building blocks and core concepts<p>

4. Business Process Modelling<p>
<ul>
<li> Identifying and naming (sub-)processes</li>
<li> Making the model executable: Defining complete business rules and read models</li>
</ul>
<p>
5. Aggregate Modelling<p>
<ul>
  <li> Identifying aggregates and creating the blueprint of a domain model implementation</li>
  <li> Where to cut, when to combine: How bounded contexts should shape our software design</li>
</ul>
<p>
6. Outlook:<br>
<ul>
<li> What happens then? Some suggestions for tactical design</li>
<li> What EventStorming can’t do: Managing customer expectations</li>
<li> How and when should I practise? Becoming an EventStorming facilitator</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Target audience:</h3>
<p>
Usually people with a background in business analysis, software design, architecture, or group facilitation. Running the workshop requires both people skills and analytic thinking — EventStorming itself is really for everyone: The activities are very intuitive and require no prior training.<p>
<h3>About the trainer:</h3>
<p>
Tobias Goeschel is an experienced EventStorming facilitator, with plenty of practical knowledge of Domain Driven Design from many projects, in multiple industries. He has been working in software development as a crafter, consultant and coach for more than twenty years. He is also a frequent participant and speaker at international (un-)conferences, and co-organizes SoCraTes Germany.<p>
