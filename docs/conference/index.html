        <h3>Call for Collaboration</h3>

        <p>We are now selecting speakers for our first edition. Make yourself known by mid April 2019! For the first edition, we have already invited our international speakers and are now looking for local speakers from Finland.
        </p>

        <p>We seek 30 minute talks on topics around technical agile: programming practices and technologies, testing practices and technologies, devops and team level stories of success and failure.</p>

        <p>We are committed to ensuring our speakers don't pay to speak - we compensate travel and stay - but also profit sharing with all the speakers.</p>

        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

        <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our conference are required to agree to the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

        <p>
          <b>Be Kind, Considerate and Respectful.
          </b>
        </p>

        <p>We’re bringing together a diverse group from different experiences and backgrounds to learn about technical agile and software craft. Let’s be good to one another and keep in mind this is a professional conference. We don’t accept bad behavior. We believe in being kind to one another even when we don’t agree. Safety is a prerequisite for learning and our conference is a place for learning.</p>

        <p>We remind everyone that coming from different experiences, everyone’s perspectives are welcome. Please be mindful about explaining things to others and ask permission before jumping into giving feedback. Think of things that are offensive to others and avoid them, discuss them in a good spirit as differences of perceptions coming from our different experiences. We provide a space to seek to understand by dialogue. We seek people listening each other, rather than arguing.</p>

        <p>If there is any reason to seek support or resolution, the organizers are here to help.</p>

        <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), chosen work role (e.g. tester) or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the information desk or use the contact details posted around the venue immediately.</p>

        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at the conference venue and conference-related social events.</p>
