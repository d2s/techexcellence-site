        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>
          Agile Software Development is about working in self-organized, cross functional teams.
          Within <a href="http://agile.fi">Agile Finland</a>, we share a lot of great tips on
          being and becoming Agile, and this conference focuses on the technical,
          team-level-doing side of Agile. What should our architecture
          and design work look like? Is technical leadership different from other facilitation?
          What are the essential practices for effective working on code?
          How do we build pipelines and test automation, and monitor production? How do we learn
          to deliver incrementally and what practices really support that?
        </p>

        <p>
          Tech Excellence brings together technical agile disciplines from software
          crafting to devops and domain driven design with focus on team level practices
          and skills for agile software development. Agile Software
          Development without top-notch technical practices doesn't
          deliver what we hope with Agile.

    <td> KEYNOTE: Amelié Cornélis: Get some attitude! How to become technically excellent
 </td>
 <!-- <td> Being better than yesterday, on a continuous journey - that is what being technically excellent is about. It’s a commitment to keep moving rather than a destination you arrive at. Every step takes you forward, sometimes via an unexpected path! All these steps combined take you a long way.

There are so many things to learn that people sometimes feel overwhelmed. There is an infinite number of directions and paths to choose from, but what you choose isn’t the point. The point is that you keep going, don’t stop and help others on their journey where you can. The combined effect of these improvements is what truly unlocks excellency.

In this talk, you learn from my lessons on the practical stepping stones that are helping along the way, such as deliberate practice with targeted exercises or code retreats, reflecting with peers both in and out of work, and raising self awareness: how best do *you* learn.

One does not simply… become excellent. It takes work and this talk shed lights on some of the necessary steps.

According to Melvin Conway, the organizational structures manifest themselves in org’s software product structure. In other words, dysfunctional organization would produce dysfunctional software architecture. Let’s try to examine different organizational structures and see how they can affect our architecture. Dmitry will review real life examples, explaining which org structures support good kind architecture and which structures are making this nearly impossible to work.</td>-->

We will learn some good practices to build a Serverless application that can be monitored and how to create good metrics for Serverless applications.
We will focus on Serverless applications on AWS and the tools that AWS provides to monitor these applications.Finally we will take a look at some of the available tools that are in the market to do this.</td>-->

Everything is either a Success or Error, or rather a Future of Success or Errors. During the talk, few monads are discussed, like Maybe and Either, using examples from SanctuaryJS (which is used in the app). Also some good practices that makes the domain code easy to understand.

        <p>
          <b>Be Kind, Considerate and Respectful.
          </b>
        </p>

        <p>We’re bringing together a diverse group from different experiences and backgrounds to learn about technical agile and software craft. Let’s be good to one another and keep in mind this is a professional conference. We don’t accept bad behavior. We believe in being kind to one another even when we don’t agree. Safety is a prerequisite for learning and our conference is a place for learning.</p>

        <p>We remind everyone that coming from different experiences, everyone’s perspectives are welcome. Please be mindful about explaining things to others and ask permission before jumping into giving feedback. Think of things that are offensive to others and avoid them, discuss them in a good spirit as differences of perceptions coming from our different experiences. We provide a space to seek to understand by dialogue. We seek people listening each other, rather than arguing.</p>

        <p>If there is any reason to seek support or resolution, the organizers are here to help.</p>

        <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), chosen work role (e.g. tester) or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
